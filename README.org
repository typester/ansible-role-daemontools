* ansible-role-daemontools

  Install daemontools and wait reboot (if newly installed)

** Supported OS
   - Ubuntu (only 12.04 tested)

** vagrant notes
   If you use this role with vagrant, you need to set private network in Vagrantfile.

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.111.222"
   #+END_SRC

   Otherwise, your ansible will wait reboot forever.
